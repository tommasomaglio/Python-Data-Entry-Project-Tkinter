# Python-Data-Entry-Project-Tkinter

In this project I created a Data Entry Form to make the data entry process of excel easier and more straightforward.

This project has room for a lot of customisation, in this case i customized it to be a data entry form for a jewellery shop but with a few small tweaks to the code you can adapt it to almost anything.

Credit for the theme goes to user: "rdbende" and the whole project is inspires to the "Code First with Hala" tutorial available on youtube.
